Functions checklist

1. Did you start your function definition with 'def'?
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open parenthesis right after function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the open parenthesis separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (no duplicate names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and colon after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function with exactly 4 spaces?
8. Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent?

When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by comas?
4. Did you end the function with a ) character?
